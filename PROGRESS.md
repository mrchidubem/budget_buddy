## Progress Log

This file tracks all changes and decisions as we integrate MySQL and Supabase.

### 2025-09-02
- Scanned repository structure and key configs.
- Detected Django stack with MySQL support and Supabase integration already present.
  - `requirements.txt` includes `mysqlclient`, `dj-database-url`, and `supabase`.
  - `budget_buddy/settings.py` uses `DATABASE_URL` if set; else defaults to MySQL (`DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, etc.).
  - `budget/views.py` contains a `SupabaseManager` for CRUD to `budgets` table.
  - `env_template.txt` contains Supabase keys and DB vars (currently Postgres defaults in comments).
- No code changes made yet to DB settings; only analysis.

Next steps
- Plan MySQL connection details (env variables, local vs production).
- Plan Supabase client usage and health checks.
- Implement connections and add quick verification endpoints.
